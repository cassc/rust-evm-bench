# Benchmark Rust EVM

To run the benchmark, 

``` bash
cargo run --release
```

It will 
* First deploy a compiled ERC20 contract
* Get the address of the deployed contract
* Execute a transfer call method from the contract by microbenchmark for 30secs
* Call the same method for 100_000 times


Sample results:
